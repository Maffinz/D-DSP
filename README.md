Senior Project 2020
Dungeons and Dragon Online
1st January 2021


<b>OVERVIEW</b>
Online platform for Dungeons and Dragons players. By making an online platform, we are able to connect players around the world for a match of Dungeons and Dragons. There is no need to worry about not finishing the same as the match will be saved to be later continued.
<b>GOALS</b>
Connect friends using out platform to play a match of Dungeons and Dragons
Save the match so players can later resume the game.
<b>SPECIFICATIONS</b>
By using unity we are able to easily create a light-weight game. We are able to add graphics and not be limited to one’s imagination. For multiplayer, Photon is a great library for Unity as they provide the server and connections.

<b>MILESTONES Week 1(Version Alpha 1.0)</b>
<b>Real-Time Tile Editor</b>
We want to give the ability to the Game Master to edit the board to his liking. Since the game is 2D our first prototype will consist of being able to edit tile by tile and then later be able to have objects such as Trees, Mountains, Rivers, Rocks, etc. and/or be able to edit multiple tiles at a time
<b>Multiplayer</b>
Our main goal is connect friends and be able to meet new people while enjoying a good match of Dungeons and Dragons. For our first alpha test, we will be able to connect players. 5 player per match with only one match available (Free Version)

<b>MILESTONES Week 2 (Version Alpha 2.0)</b>
<b>Heads-Up Display for Players</b>
As the player progresses in the game, stats and many other information may become harder to keep track of and make a calculated decision accordingly. Keeping track of their stats as the game goes and updating them Real-Tile is a new tool Dungeons and Dragons players may be able to use.
<b>Edit Tiles</b>
As a player or DM you may want to edit the tile, putting traps or maybe removing some stuff. Maybe make something collide. We want to give the freedom for the DM to edit each tile and the type of tile they want to edit. As well as giving the player an opportunity to use his skills to put anything on any given tile or.
<b>Zoom In/Zoom Out</b
It’s a game board, it’s either go big or go home. Although we will implement Fog of war at one point we still want to give the player SPECIALLY the DM the ability to zoom in/zoom out of the game board and move around. Have the flexibility to move around the map with ease.
